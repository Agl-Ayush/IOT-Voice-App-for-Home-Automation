# IOT-Voice-App-for-Home-Automation

I developed interface that takes voice instructions from user and
control lights of through Relays.
I worked upon configuration of Esp32/8266 module through IP address which connects to app. Esp32 was used which is bluetooth/wifi module
supported.
I ensured that app seamlessly integrates with Google Voice Assistant, utilizing its powerful speech recognition capabilities for enhanced user
interaction.
